To resolve the conflict merging error, you will type, "git pull", 
as it mentions in the terminal. Pulling out the files will then 
proceed you to the screeen while you will be declaring which file
you will want to push to the direct repository. By cilcking on one
of the files and exiting out of the "task" bar, visional studio 
code will then upload and fix the merging conflict to your 
direct repository. 

As for the three changes that I have made in part C, I made an 
update to every one of them to keep up the updates. When it comes 
to the changes, I will follow these three steps in order to push 
the files into the direct "working" repository, git add, git commit,
and git push. By typing in git add, I will be able to change to 
one or all of my files which saves the current screenshot of one or
all the files. By then, you will git commit your files to add a message
before pushing the files, this gives the readers to understand 
your thinking process and what changes you have made within these files. 
Finally, you have git push. By pushing these files, you will then update
your repository with the files you're currently working on as a placeholder
or a checkpoint to your projects. These are the changes I have made 
to the files from part c to my direct working repsitory.
